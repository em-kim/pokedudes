some dumb fun

Let's use the pokemon api(v2) and mobx to build a little app. 

The docs can be found here: https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/ 
But honestly, you don't really need to read them for this exercise. There's no key necessary and all the urls we'll be using 
will essentially be: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{integer} where integer is some integer that's not huge (I'm not sure how
many pokemon there are anymore, pokemon died to me the day they went more than 150)

using that information build a little app that has the following routes that display the following things:

/picture
displays the image of the pokemon - found in the api response, just choose one of the sprites. This can be the default page.

/moves
displays the first 10 moves name

/stats
displays the first 3 stats like so: [ { {base_stat}: {name} }, { {base_stat}: {name}, ...]
!!!! put the logic that that builds the array in the store and use a getter method as an observable !!!!
A big part of mobx is moving logic into stores. If this is lost on you, you're missing a big feature of mobx. 

finally build a nav bar that does two things: display the pokemons name on the left side and has an input and button on 
the right side which allows a user to input an integer and upon clicking the button calls the api, using the input as the
{integer} and updates the store, which should then update the name of the pokemon and each route's component. 

This shouldn't be too crazy, use create-react-app, react-router, mobx, axios, and any other technology you're familiar with. 
I use oxford commas, buzz off...
